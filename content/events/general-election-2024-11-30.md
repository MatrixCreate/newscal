  description: Incumbent Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth will likely face an emboldened and increasingly united opposition. The elections will be conducted in a context of heightened anti-government sentiment given cost of living pressures and alleged corruption in the ruling Mauritian Alliance coalition government. This will fuel minor incidents of unrest, but widespread instability is highly unlikely. Location- Mauritius.
